/**
 * Orchestration config base contracts shared across the framework.
 *
 * These types live in `@dzupagent/agent-types` (Layer 0) so that
 * `@dzupagent/agent` and `@dzupagent/agent-adapters` can specialize a
 * single canonical shape for each multi-agent orchestration pattern
 * without duplicating field definitions that drift over time.
 *
 * Each base contract is a structural skeleton: consumers extend it via
 * type intersection to add package-specific fields (e.g. an agent-side
 * `manager: DzupAgent` or an adapter-side `registry: ProviderAdapterRegistry`).
 *
 * The optional shape is intentional — it lets both the agent-centric and
 * the registry-centric implementations specialize from the same base
 * without mismatched required fields. Specializations are free (and
 * encouraged) to tighten optionality on their own extension fields.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This file MUST NOT import from any other `@dzupagent/*`
 * package — `@dzupagent/agent-types` sits at Layer 0 of the dependency
 * graph and runtime symbols (e.g. `DzupEventBus`) belong to higher layers.
 * Specializing packages bring those types in via intersection.

/**
 * Base contract for the Team-Coordination orchestration pattern family.

 * validation; each pattern implementation owns the participant scheduling
 * and merge semantics for one specific pattern.

 * This contract is intentionally structural (no class import) so the
 * agent-types layer stays free of runtime symbols. The `@dzupagent/agent`
 * package narrows the generic params (`TContext`, `TResult`,
 * `TCheckpoint`) to its concrete `TeamPatternContext` /
 * `TeamPatternResult` / `TeamCheckpoint` types.
